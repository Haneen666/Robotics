# 🤖 Robotics Project (Arduino)

A robotics project that I **designed and programmed independently** using Arduino, including autonomous behaviors and sensor-based actions.

🚀 Focused on building robots that interact with the environment using sensors and microcontrollers.

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates:

- Obstacle avoidance
- Line following
- Sensor integration (ultrasonic, infrared, etc.)
- Motor control
- Fully autonomous robot behavior

All hardware assembly and programming were done independently.

## ✨ Features
- Autonomous navigation
- Sensor-based decision making
- Arduino programming (C++)
- Real-world testing
- Modular and expandable code

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO / Arduino Nano
- C++ (Arduino IDE)
- Sensors: Ultrasonic, IR, Light, etc.
- Motors and motor drivers
- Breadboard and wiring components

---

## 🏗️ My Role
- Hardware assembly and wiring
- Programming the Arduino microcontroller
- Integrating sensors
- Testing and optimizing robot behavior
- Designing circuits and layouts

---


## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more autonomous behaviors
- Wireless control (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
